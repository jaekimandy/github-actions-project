## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Actions in your fork
3. Configure required secrets (see Security section)
4. Push changes to trigger workflows

## 📦 Dependency Management

This project uses Python version-specific dependency files to ensure compatibility across different Python versions:

- **requirements-py39.txt**: Python 3.9 compatible dependencies
- **requirements-py310.txt**: Python 3.10 compatible dependencies  
- **requirements-py311.txt**: Python 3.11 compatible dependencies

The CI/CD pipeline automatically selects the appropriate dependency file based on the Python version being tested.
